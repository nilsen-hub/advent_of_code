The last document got a bit cluttered. I now have tools to do quicker
calculations, so I'm starting over.

Lets restate the problem, the test data is below:

???.### 1,1,3
.??..??...?##. 1,1,3
?#?#?#?#?#?#?#? 1,3,1,6
????.#...#... 4,1,1
????.######..#####. 1,6,5
?###???????? 3,2,1

This is solved line by line, one line contains a string and some numbers
The numbers on the right represents contiguous groups of a size n
The string on the left is the grid these groups are to be placed into.
The rules for placing the groups are:

- The groups must appear in the order shown in the numbers on the right.
- No two groups may be directly next to eachother.
- '.' in the grid must not be covered.
- '#' in grid must be covered.
- '?' may or may not be covered.

Examples:

???.### 1,1,3 = 1
        0,1,2

0.1.222

.??..??...?##. 1,1,3 = 4
               0,1,2

.0...1....222.
.0....1...222.
..0..1....222.
..0...1...222. 

?###???????? 3,2,1 = 10
             0,1,2

.000.11.2...
.000.11..2..
.000.11...2.
.000.11....2
.000..11.2..
.000..11..2.
.000..11...2
.000...11.2.
.000...11..2
.000....11.2   

The task is to figure out how many ways you can put the numbers into the string.

What I have figured out this far.

The individual groups have X amount of "freedoms", at least one.
Groups with exactly one freedom, regardless of what the other groups are 
doing are "locked"
Groups whose freedoms are unaffected by the motion of other groups are "single"
Groups whose freedoms are 100% affected by the motion of other groups are "married"
Some groups have both single configurations and married configurations,
These are "Hybrids"

Locked groups are ignored.
Single groups are simply multiplied up with the rest of the freedoms.
Hybrids are mysterious for now.
Married groups have some connection to triangular numbers.
Two groups, married to eachother, are considered as one group with the amount of
freedoms = /\shared freedoms.

Example:
?###???????? 3,2,1

[0] is locked
[2] and [1] are married, so [2,1]
[2,1] shares 4 freedoms, the triangular number of 4 is 10.

The final answer is 1*10 = 10 (the locked group times the married group)

Things get a bit more complicated once we venture into more groups sharing more
freedoms.

Locked group has one freedom.
Single groups has more than one freedom.
2 married groups has the triangular number of shared freedoms freedoms.
I write that out like this /\base, where shared freedoms are the base

A group looking like this:
Case {1.1}
?????????? 1,1,1

has 36 configurations.
The above conguration will be notated as 2 & 8 from now on. 3 groups sharing 8
freedoms.

n & x 
3 & 8

Further notation notes:
I use /\ to note a triangle. So the triangular number with a base of 8:
/\8

We will also run into the concept of the meta, or higher order triangle:
Where /\8 is the sum of 8+7+6+5+4+3+2+1
The first higher order triangle will look like this (still base of 8):
2/\8.
Thats a second order triangle, and you calculate this by adding up the 
triangular numbers down the list so:
2/\8 = /\8+/\7+/\6+/\5+/\4+/\3+/\2+/\1
A third order triangle would be to add all second order triangles together
and so on..

n & x 
2 & x = (n-1)/\x 
3 & x = (n-1)/\x
4 & 8 = (n-1)/\x
...
8 & 32 = (n-1)/\x = 61523748
